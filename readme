# Stripe Payment Gateway Integration (React & Node.js)

This project demonstrates how to integrate Stripe's payment gateway in a full-stack application using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express** for the backend.

## Features

- **Stripe Payment Gateway**: Enables secure payments using Stripe's API.
- **React Frontend**: Simple UI to collect and send payment details.
- **Node.js Backend**: Handles the payment processing with Stripe.
- **CORS Support**: Ensures secure cross-origin communication between frontend and backend.
- **Idempotency Key**: Prevents duplicate charges due to multiple requests.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Fetch API
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Stripe API
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe (for handling secure payments)

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- NPM or Yarn
- A Stripe account with API keys for test mode

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd stripe-payment-integration

## Backend Setup (Node.js & Express)
# Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd server

## Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install

## Configure environment variables:

# Create a .env file in the server directory and add your Stripe secret key and other environment variables:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
PORT=3000

## Run the backend server:

```bash
npm start
This will start the backend server on http://localhost:3000.

## Frontend Setup (React)
# Navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd client

## Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
## Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
This will start the React app on http://localhost:3001.

## Environment Variables
Ensure you have the following environment variables set in your .env file:

## Backend .env file:
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
PORT=3000
## Frontend .env file:
You can store the Stripe publishable key in the frontendâ€™s environment file for security:

```bash
VITE_APP_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
